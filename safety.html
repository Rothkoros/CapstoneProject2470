                          Talk about earthquakes with your family so that everyone knows what to do in case of an earthquake. Discussing ahead of time helps reduce fear, particularly for younger children
                          <br>
                          Check at your workplace and your children's schools and day care centers to learn about their earthquake emergency plans.
                          <br>
                          Pick safe places in each room of your home, workplace and/or school. A safe place could be under a piece of furniture or against an interior wall away from windows, bookcases or tall furniture that could fall on you.
                          <br>
                          Practice DROP, COVER and HOLD ON in each safe place.

                          Make sure you have access to NOAA radio broadcasts:

                          Find an online NOAA radio station

                          Purchase a battery-powered or hand-crank NOAA radio.
                          <br>
                          Keep a flashlight and any low-heeled shoes by each person’s bed.

                          Prepare a pet emergency kit for your companion animals.
                          <br>
                          Bolt and brace water heaters and gas appliances to wall studs. Have a professional install flexible fittings to avoid gas or water leaks.
                          <br>
                          Do not hang heavy items, such as pictures and mirrors, near beds, couches and anywhere people sleep or sit.
                          <br>
                          Install strong latches or bolts on cabinets. Large or heavy items should be closest to the floor.
                          <br>
                          Learn how to shut off the gas valves in your home and keep a wrench handy for that purpose.
                          <br>
                          Place large and heavy objects and breakable items (bottled foods, glass or china) on lower shelves.
                          <br>
                          Anchor overhead lighting fixtures to joists.
                          <br>
                          Anchor top-heavy, tall and freestanding furniture such as bookcases, china cabinets to wall studs to keep these from toppling over.
                          <br>
                          Ask about home repair and strengthening tips for exterior features, such as porches, decks, sliding glass doors, canopies, carports and garage doors.
                          <br>
                          Learn about your area’s seismic building standards and land use codes before you begin new construction.
                          <br>
                          Have a professional make sure your home is securely anchored to its foundation, as well as strengthening tips for exterior features, such as porches, decks, sliding glass doors, canopies, carports and garage doors.

                      <p>
                          If you are inside you should:
                          <br>
                          DROP, COVER and HOLD ON!
                          <br>
                          Move as little as possible - most injuries during earthquakes occur because of people moving around, falling and suffering sprains, fractures and head injuries.
                          <br>
                          Try to protect your head and torso.
                          <br>
                          If you are in bed, stay there, curl up and hold on, and cover your head.
                          <br>
                          Stay indoors until the shaking stops and you are sure it is safe to exit.
                          <br>
                          If you must leave a building after the shaking stops, use stairs rather than an elevator in case of aftershocks, power outages or other damage.
                          <br>
                          Be aware that smoke alarms and sprinkler systems frequently go off in buildings during an earthquake, even if there is no fire.
                          <br>
                          If you smell gas, get out of the house and move as far away as possible.
                          <br>
                          Before you leave any building check to make sure that there is no debris from the building that could fall on you.

                      <p>
                         If away from home, return only when authorities say it is safe to do so.
                         <br>
                         Check yourself for injuries and get first aid, if necessary, before helping injured or trapped persons.
                         <br>
                         After an earthquake, the disaster may continue. Expect and prepare for potential aftershocks, landslides or even a tsunami if you live on a coast.
                         <br>
                         Each time you feel an aftershock, DROP, COVER and HOLD ON. Aftershocks frequently occur minutes, days, weeks and even months following an earthquake.
                         <br>
                         Look for and extinguish small fires. Fire is the most common hazard after an earthquake.
